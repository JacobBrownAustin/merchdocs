Product reviews help to build a sense of community, and are considered more credible than any advertising money can buy. In fact, some search engines give sites with product reviews a higher ranking than those without. For those who find your site by searching for a specific product, a product review is essentially the landing page of your store. Product reviews help people find your store, keep them engaged, and often lead to sales.

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source offer multiple product review options:

<div class="bs-callout-info" markdown="1">
Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source releases 2.4.0 through 2.4.3 included the Yotpo vendor-developed extension. Starting with the 2.4.4 release, this extension is no longer bundled with the core release and must be installed and updated from the Commerce Marketplace. The Marketplace also provides access to current documentation provided by the extension developer.

If you have the bundled extension enabled and configured, you must update your composer.json file as part of the 2.4.4 upgrade process and to manage extension updates going forward. See [Upgrade modules]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/guides/v{{ site.version }}/comp-mgr/upgrade-module.html) in the _Upgrade Guide_ for more information.
